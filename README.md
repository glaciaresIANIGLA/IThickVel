# IThickVel
Ice thickness distribution from surface velocity 

Matlab function to derived glaciers ice thickness distribution from surface velocity like Gantayat et al. (2014) developed by Lucas Ruiz.

Folder IThickVel_V1 (Ruiz and others, 2015). 
  First version of the function.
  
  


Folder IThickVel_V2_1 (Villalba and others, 2017; Zorzut and others, 2020). Second version of the function.  Better representation of ice thickness at glaciers calving fronts.
It includes some sampling data and sampling script to call the ithickvel_v2_1.m function to calculate the ice thickness distribution, internal deformation and basal velocity of Perito Moreno glacier in the Southern Patagonian Icefield.
